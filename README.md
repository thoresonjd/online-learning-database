# online-learning-database
During remote learning, students are taking classes at home, and many of them reside in parts of the world that are far away from the institution in which they are enrolled at. This database is meant to illustrate what Seattle University could have potentially decided to do if the online learning persisted for an extensive period of time. The database is meant to serve a scheduling service that allows professors to schedule events for their students, where the students can easily convert their classes and other meetings to their time zone. Information regarding professors, students, scheduled events, and the location of the events are stored in the database as well as the connections between them.
